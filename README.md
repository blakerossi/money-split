# money-split
Program to split money fairly between participators when total goes up or down.

I created this program for when my friends and I pool together our money to gamble, the program will split the ending total fairly based on the ratios created when you initally "buy in".

Degenerate, I know.

How to run:

1. Run the program
2. Enter the starting ammounts each of you are "buying in" for seperated by spaces, hit Enter
3. Enter the final total you ended with, hit Enter
4. Read the outcome. Each number will be in the corresponding order you initally entered the values
